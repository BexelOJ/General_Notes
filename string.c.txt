Here is a list of functions provided by the string.h header along with brief definitions:

memchr()
Searches for the first occurrence of a specific character in a block of memory.

memcmp()
Compares two blocks of memory byte by byte.

memcpy()
Copies a specified number of bytes from one memory block to another.

memmove()
Copies a specified number of bytes from one memory block to another, handling overlapping regions.

memset()
Sets a specified number of bytes in a memory block to a given value.

strcat()
Appends a null-terminated string to the end of another string.

strchr()
Searches for the first occurrence of a character in a string.

strcmp()
Compares two strings lexicographically.

strcoll()
Compares two strings using the current localeâ€™s collation rules.

strcpy()
Copies a null-terminated string from one to another.

strcspn()
Returns the length of the initial segment of a string that does not contain any of the characters in another string.

strdup()
Allocates memory and copies a string into that memory (not in all implementations).

strpbrk()
Searches for the first occurrence of any of a set of characters in a string.

strrchr()
Searches for the last occurrence of a character in a string.

strspn()
Returns the length of the initial segment of a string that contains only characters from another string.

strstr()
Searches for the first occurrence of a substring in a string.

strtok()
Splits a string into tokens based on delimiters.

strncpy()
Copies a specified number of characters from one string to another, stopping early if the null terminator is found.

strncat()
Appends a specified number of characters from one string to another.

strncmp()
Compares the first n characters of two strings lexicographically.

strncpy() (listed again due to earlier mention)

strnlen()
Returns the length of a string, but not exceeding a specified maximum length.

strerror()
Returns a pointer to the textual description of an error code.

strtok_r()
A reentrant version of strtok(), which allows tokenizing a string in a thread-safe way.

------------------------------------------------------------

These functions are used for various string manipulation tasks, such as searching, comparing, copying, and tokenizing strings, along with memory management.
